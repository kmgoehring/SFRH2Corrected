SFRH2Corrected
==============

Calculates corrected star formation for astronomy research. 

  		   A brief class/UI that runs calculations off user
          input and returns various useful values for astronomical research
          concerning star formation rates and molecular hydrogen masses.
          Applies distance conversions, deprojected area and axis caluclations,
          and gas and star formation rate densities. These star formation rates are 
          corrected using the total infrared (TIR) luminosities from the paper
          "Engelbracht, C.W., Rieke, G.H., Gordon, K.D., etal. 2008, ApJ, 678, 804"
          Any variable naming using Englebracht refers to this paper. Hydrogen-alpha 
          luminosities are supplied in "Gil de Paz, A., Madore, B.F., Pevunova1, O. 2003,ApJS, 147, 29"
